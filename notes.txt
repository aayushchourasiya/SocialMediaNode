PostGreSql commands to start

brew services start postgresql@15
brew link postgresql@15 --force


createdb => for creating database of local machine username
After this, run => psql => to go to psql terminal 
When above commands work, it will open the psql terminal. Now to go to our database, run below command:  \c socialmedia;

socialmedia is the name of my database here and \c is for changing database. 


This is for initializing psql:

const pool = new pg.Pool({
  user: 'aayush',
  host: 'localhost',
  database: 'socialmedia',
  password: 'test',
  port: 5432,
});

I used env files for this in this project
